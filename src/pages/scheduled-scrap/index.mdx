Recently I had a thing. I wanted to

- Scrape things every midnight
- Commit the result into the repository (and push to the remote, of course)
- Build the website (it's on gatsby)

So this post will briefly guide you how I went through those.

### 1. Triggering deployment with webhook

Netlify provides a webhook endpoint. Zapier triggers it every midnight. I've followed the steps from [this post](https://flaviocopes.com/netlify-auto-deploy/).

### 2. Scraping things

When the webhook is triggered, Netlify executes the deployment script(for example, `yarn build`). By the way, the timeout is [15 minutes](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/18/how-our-build-bots-build-sites/).

### 3. commit && push

Let's say scrapper has dropped the result at `data/2019-01-01.json`. I want to commit and push the change. When this deployment was made by Netlify, it checked out the repository in a `detached head state`. So we need to do a few things in order to properly make a commit on `master` branch.

```bash
git config --global user.email "my-email@address.com"
git config --global user.name "my-user-name"
git checkout master
git pull https://$MY_GIT_USERNAME:$MY_GIT_PASSWORD@github.com:your/project.git master

run_some_scraping_here

git add data/*
git commit -m "add new data @ netlify"
git push https://$MY_GIT_USERNAME:$MY_GIT_PASSWORD@github.com:your/project.git master
```

First I set git config so that commit can be made with correct information(By default, there's none, so commit fails).

And to access my git repository, I set `MY_GIT_USERNAME` and `MY_GIT_PASSWORD` at [Build Environment Variables on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables). Don't ever commit this info into your git repository.

At first, I'm in a detached head state, so I need to `git checkout master` before making any commit. And `git pull` to make sure I'm on the latest version. When I was testing, after `git checkout master`, the master branch was still pointing to an old commit. I guess it's because of some caching issue.

After making the local branch up-to-date, you can run some scraping job. And stage, commit and push the change.

And now you can go on with building your website with the recently scrapped data.

### 4. One more thing,

When I just pushed the new commit to my remote repository, it just triggered another deployment at Netlify! That's totally unnecessary. So if I managed to push new commit, then current deployment may just stop there so that new deployment will cover it.

```bash
git commit -m "add new data @ netlify"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
  # New data added, so let's push and just quit this deploy.
  # This push will trigger new deployment.
  git push https://$MY_GIT_USERNAME:$MY_GIT_PASSWORD@github.com:your/project.git master
  exit 1
else
  # nothing added, let's keep continuing.
  exit 0
fi
```

So that's what I've done. With this way, if there's any new commit, it will push and just exit with non-zero code, stopping the current deployment and triggering new fresh deployment by push. If there's nothing newly committed, it goes on with the current deployment.

This will cover both midnight scheduled deployment and usual deployment triggered by my own `git push`.
